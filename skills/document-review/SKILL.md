# Document Review

Review requirements or plan documents through multi-persona analysis. Dispatches specialized reviewer agents in parallel, auto-fixes quality issues, and presents strategic questions for user decision.

## Phase 1: Get and Analyze Document

**If a document path is provided:** Read it, then proceed.

**If no document is specified:** Ask which document to review, or find the most recent in `docs/brainstorms/` or `docs/plans/` using a file-search/glob tool (e.g., Glob in Claude Code).

### Classify Document Type

After reading, classify the document:
- **requirements** -- from `docs/brainstorms/`, focuses on what to build and why
- **plan** -- from `docs/plans/`, focuses on how to build it with implementation details

### Select Conditional Personas

Analyze the document content to determine which conditional personas to activate. Check for these signals:

**product-lens** -- activate when the document contains:
- User-facing features, user stories, or customer-focused language
- Market claims, competitive positioning, or business justification
- Scope decisions, prioritization language, or priority tiers with feature assignments
- Requirements with user/customer/business outcome focus

**design-lens** -- activate when the document contains:
- UI/UX references, frontend components, or visual design language
- User flows, wireframes, screen/page/view mentions
- Interaction descriptions (forms, buttons, navigation, modals)
- References to responsive behavior or accessibility

**security-lens** -- activate when the document contains:
- Auth/authorization mentions, login flows, session management
- API endpoints exposed to external clients
- Data handling, PII, payments, tokens, credentials, encryption
- Third-party integrations with trust boundary implications

**scope-guardian** -- activate when the document contains:
- Multiple priority tiers (P0/P1/P2, must-have/should-have/nice-to-have)
- Large requirement count (>8 distinct requirements or implementation units)
- Stretch goals, nice-to-haves, or "future work" sections
- Scope boundary language that seems misaligned with stated goals
- Goals that don't clearly connect to requirements

**adversarial** -- activate when the document contains:
- More than 5 distinct requirements or implementation units
- Explicit architectural or scope decisions with stated rationale
- High-stakes domains (auth, payments, data migrations, external integrations)
- Proposals of new abstractions, frameworks, or significant architectural patterns

## Phase 2: Announce and Dispatch Personas

### Announce the Review Team

Tell the user which personas will review and why. For conditional personas, include the justification:

```
Reviewing with:
- coherence-reviewer (always-on)
- feasibility-reviewer (always-on)
- scope-guardian-reviewer -- plan has 12 requirements across 3 priority levels
- security-lens-reviewer -- plan adds API endpoints with auth flow
```

### Build Agent List

Always include:
- `spec-first:document-review:coherence-reviewer`
- `spec-first:document-review:feasibility-reviewer`

Add activated conditional personas:
- `spec-first:document-review:product-lens-reviewer`
- `spec-first:document-review:design-lens-reviewer`
- `spec-first:document-review:security-lens-reviewer`
- `spec-first:document-review:scope-guardian-reviewer`
- `spec-first:document-review:adversarial-document-reviewer`

### Dispatch

Dispatch all agents in **parallel** using the platform's task/agent tool (e.g., Agent tool in Claude Code, spawn in Codex). Each agent receives the prompt built from the subagent template included below with these variables filled:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `{persona_file}` | Full content of the agent's markdown file |
| `{schema}` | Content of the findings schema included below |
| `{document_type}` | "requirements" or "plan" from Phase 1 classification |
| `{document_path}` | Path to the document |
| `{document_content}` | Full text of the document |

Pass each agent the **full document** -- do not split into sections.

**Error handling:** If an agent fails or times out, proceed with findings from agents that completed. Note the failed agent in the Coverage section. Do not block the entire review on a single agent failure.

**Dispatch limit:** Even at maximum (7 agents), use parallel dispatch. These are document reviewers with bounded scope reading a single document -- parallel is safe and fast.

## Phases 3-5: Synthesis, Presentation, and Next Action

After all dispatched agents return, read `references/synthesis-and-presentation.md` for the synthesis pipeline (validate, gate, dedup, promote, resolve contradictions, pattern-resolved auto promotion, route by autofix class), auto-fix application, finding presentation, and next-action menu. Do not load this file before agent dispatch completes.
